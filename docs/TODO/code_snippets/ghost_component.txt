FROM GAME:
I’ve outfitted you with a special type of energy weapon that allows you to control machines.
  While standing on the ground, <b>hold down the attack button</b> for a few seconds to charge up the <b>Possession Orb</b>.
Once the Possession Orb is released, you can control its movement by tilting the phone.
  Running it into a mechanical object will allow you to possess that object.
  Pressing the attack button will destroy it and return control to your body.
Try possessing that robot down there and using him to break through those blue blocks.
  Here’s a hint: releasing a possessed robot causes it to explode.
