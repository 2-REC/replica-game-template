convert a level to the engine:

- edit in hexa & parse file to extract each layer in a separate file
	Each layer starts from byte "2A".

	signature		1			96
	layerCount		1
	backgroundIndex		1

	for each layer:
		type		1
		tileIndex	1
		scrollSpeed	4			(float)

		world (TiledWorld)
		signature	1			42
		mRowCount	4			(int)
		mColCount	4			(int)
		mTilesArray	mRowCount*mColCount	(int[][])

- set files extension to "bin"
- correct hot spots
	- in hot spots layer (TYPE == 03), replace hot spots values that are different than "FF" by new correspondent values.
		(see "hotspots_correspondences.txt" for correspondences)
- create level's xml file
	- refer bin files
		- !!!! layer used for "main layer" is the first one with "TYPE == 0" ????
	- set dialogs
		(+ create dialog file & strings)
- refer level xml file in level_tree.xml
- get all required drawables (& strings)
